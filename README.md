# Search Rdio

A simple [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com) extension to search for artists on the Rdio OS X app.

## Usage

You must have the [PowerPack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) to use this extension.

Download [Search Rdio.alfredextension](https://github.com/downloads/brickattack/Search-Rdio/Search%20Rdio.alfredextension) and open it. It should open with Alfred and prompt you to accept some options.

Once installed, activate Alfred and use keyword `rd` (or the keyword you chose) then input the name of the artist you want to search for.

* example `rd Black Keys`
